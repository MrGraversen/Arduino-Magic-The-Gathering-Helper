# Arduino "Magic the Gathering" Helper

This is a small project I made a while ago to do some simple tasks while enjoying a battle of Magic.

It uses a [run of the mill 2x16 LCD shield for the Arduino](https://www.dfrobot.com/wiki/images/thumb/5/5e/DFR0009-PIN2.png/900px-DFR0009-PIN2.png) with the `LiquidCrystal.h` library.

## Features

* Life counter (starts at 20, increments and decrements)
* Poison counter (starts at 0, increments and decrements)
* Roll a six-sided dice
* Roll a twenty-sided dice
* Flip a coin (produces "heads" or "tails")

Yeah. I should add some.
